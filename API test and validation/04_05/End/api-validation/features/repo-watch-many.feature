Feature: There are a number of important repositories we want to watch
  Scenario: I want to watch all the projects that my project depends on
    Given I am an authenticated user
      And I have the following repositories:
        | owner   | project   |
        | Behat   | Behat     |
        | laravel | laravel   |
        | laravel | framework |
    When  I watch each repository
    Then  My watch list will include those repositories
